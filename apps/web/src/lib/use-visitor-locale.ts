 * The visitor's language, answered rather than asked.
 *
 * Every screen in this service is reached from the visitor's own phone — the
 * QR code is on a shared kiosk, but the browser that opens it is theirs, and
 * it already carries their language in `Accept-Language`. Making them pick one
 * from a list of thirteen was a screen and a tap spent on a question the
 * service could answer itself, before they had seen the thing they came to do.
 *
 * The server resolves the same preference and renders the first paint in it, so
 * that is the snapshot handed back during hydration: defaulting to English here
 * would make a Korean visitor watch the page load in English and then change
 * under them. The picker stays in the header for the times the guess is wrong.
