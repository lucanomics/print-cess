# Authenticode signing

An unsigned Windows build is not releasable. `.github/workflows/release-kiosk.yml` compiles and
tests the tagged source first, then hands the executable to a separate `windows-signing`
environment. Only that protected job can decode the PFX, sign `Print-cess Kiosk.exe`, verify the
Windows Authenticode policy with `signtool verify /pa /all /tw /v`, require the exact approved
certificate thumbprint and a timestamp certificate, remove symbols, and create the release ZIP and
checksum. The certificate file is created only in the runner temporary directory and is removed in
a `finally` block.

The workflow must be dispatched from the exact tag named by its input. It rejects a branch run,
ref/input mismatch, tag/`github.sha` mismatch, or tag commit that is not reachable from protected
`main`. GitHub additionally restricts the `windows-signing` and `github-release` environments to
`v*` tag refs. Active repository ruleset `19197379` prevents other write actors from creating,
moving, or deleting `v*` release tags; the current `lucanomics` user remains the sole bypass and
must be replaced by an approved institutional release role before Production.

## Protected environment contract

`windows-signing` exists with a `v*` tag-only deployment policy. Required-reviewer rules are not
available for this private personal repository under its current plan, so institutional ownership
or an eligible plan is still required before configuring signing material. Then configure:

- secret `WINDOWS_SIGNING_CERT_BASE64`: base64 of the approved code-signing PFX;
- secret `WINDOWS_SIGNING_CERT_PASSWORD`: independent PFX password;
- variable `AUTHENTICODE_EXPECTED_SUBJECT`: exact approved signer subject text;
- variable `AUTHENTICODE_EXPECTED_THUMBPRINT`: approved 40-hex signer certificate thumbprint;
- variable `AUTHENTICODE_TIMESTAMP_URL`: approved RFC 3161 timestamp endpoint.

The certificate must permit code signing, have an approved private-key custody and rotation owner,
and build a trusted chain on the target Windows image. Prefer a non-exportable HSM or managed
signing service for Production; the PFX workflow is a minimum portable implementation and requires
formal exception approval if used. Do not use a self-signed certificate for acceptance.

## Acceptance evidence

The tagged publish embeds the release version and workflow commit into the executable product
version. After signing, the protected job emits `authenticode-manifest.json` and its SHA-256
sidecar. The manifest binds the tag, commit, protocol, executable length/hash/version, signer
subject/thumbprint/validity, timestamp certificate, SHA-256 digests, and SignTool policy result.

For every release candidate, retain the protected workflow run, signed ZIP checksum, tag/commit,
`authenticode-verification.txt`, manifest and independently recorded manifest digest, certificate
inventory approval, and target-device output from
`scripts/windows/Invoke-PrintCessAcceptance.ps1`. On the target Windows device, supply the approved
tag, commit, signer thumbprint, and manifest digest independently; the collector re-verifies the
installed executable and timestamp against that evidence chain. Do not copy the expected signer
thumbprint only from the manifest being tested. A valid signature does not prove institutional
approval, printer compatibility, or safe deployment.

Do not publish a stable GitHub Release until the signing environment, institutional tag-bypass
role, independent reviewer, certificate, timestamp service, target-device verification, and
revocation/rotation runbook are approved. No certificate or signed release was available during the
current macOS work.
