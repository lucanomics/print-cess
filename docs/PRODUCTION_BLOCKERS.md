# Production blockers

Status: **Production is prohibited.** The Vercel project is linked but automatic deployments are
disabled. No successful Preview/Production deployment, stable GitHub Release, signed kiosk
artifact, physical site installation, or institutional approval exists.

Every item below needs an accountable owner, dated evidence, and formal acceptance. A checked-in
configuration file or green mock test does not close an institutional gate.

## Governance and privacy

- [ ] **Institutional information-security approval.** Approve architecture, threat model,
      internet/provider use, endpoint hardening, incident response, and residual risks.
- [ ] **Privacy/legal review.** Determine controller/processor roles, Korean privacy-law basis and
      notice, cross-border transfer requirements, subject inquiries, incident handling, and physical
      output disposal.
- [ ] **Vercel and Upstash approval.** Approve Vercel web/Private Blob and Upstash Redis/QStash,
      contracts/DPA, subprocessors, support access, availability, and exit plan.
- [ ] **Data location/log/backup retention.** Document regions and retention for request logs,
      access logs, QStash delivery, Redis, Blob deletion/backups, support access, and security
      telemetry. Application deletion cannot prove immediate provider-backup erasure.
- [ ] **Brand/trademark/site-language review.** Approve Print-cess by Paradiso naming and confirm no
      confusion with Printess or an official government service.

## Provider and application security

- [ ] **Production resources and credentials.** Vercel project access exists, but no approved Blob,
      Redis, QStash, registration, administrator, release, or signing credentials were available.
      Provision separate
      Preview/Production resources and rotation owners. Evidence the fail-closed startup contract:
      exact HTTPS origins, 32-character-or-longer registration/diagnostics secrets, HTTPS Redis,
      and 20-character-or-longer Blob/Redis/QStash values. The current build requires
      `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`; OIDC-only operation is not implemented.
- [ ] **Credential-backed signed URL tests.** Against `@vercel/blob` 2.6.1, prove exact-path,
      one-operation PUT/GET/DELETE, short expiry/clock skew, content type, 10,485,911-byte maximum,
      no-overwrite, ETag comparison, conditional delete, replay, and redaction.
      The manual `Preview provider acceptance` workflow and provider-only Vitest suite are ready but
      have not run because approved credentials/resources are absent.
- [ ] **Redis atomicity under contention.** Prove Lua/CAS first-claim, upload-once, consume-once,
      terminal immutability, cleanup/consume race, and TTL behavior against approved Upstash Redis.
- [ ] **QStash delivery and recovery.** Prove current/next signature verification, delayed schedule,
      deterministic deduplication, failed/lost schedule acknowledgement replay, already-deleted
      behavior, provider outage, and bounded orphan sweep.
- [ ] **Origin/WAF/firewall policy.** Finalize the approved domain, exact CORS origins, rate limits,
      function/body/time limits, egress hostnames, denial-of-service thresholds, and monitoring.
      Capture the exact Production Private Blob download hostname(s) for the kiosk allow-list;
      wildcards, Preview hosts, signed-URL user information, and server-supplied GET headers are not
      permitted.
- [ ] **Repository controls.** `main` now requires strict PRs, conversation resolution, linear
      history, admin enforcement, and Web/Windows/dependency/Gitleaks checks, and blocks force-push
      and deletion. Remaining: independent/CODEOWNER approval, protected signing/deployment
      environments with reviewers, tag restriction, signed-commit decision, native secret scanning
      and push protection, and CodeQL. GitHub returned 422/403 because native secret/code scanning is
      unavailable for this private personal repository; upgrade/move it before setting
      `ENABLE_CODEQL=true`.
- [ ] **CI evidence privacy.** Verify that Playwright screenshots/traces and raw `test-results` stay
      disabled/excluded, only synthetic fixtures are used, Web evidence expires after three days,
      Windows TRX/publish-smoke evidence expires after seven days, and incident deletion/rotation is
      exercised for an artifact containing a credential or personal data.
- [ ] **Supply-chain approval.** Review npm/NuGet/Actions licenses and provenance, particularly
      document parser/renderer and native printing dependencies; decide immutable Action pinning.

## Windows and printing

- [ ] **Administrator controls acceptance.** The authenticated screen implements exact allow-listed
      installed-printer selection/persistence, printer status, a synthetic test print, recovery
      acknowledgement, active-session discard, app restart, redacted observations, explicit
      server/Redis/Blob/QStash status, a capped 25-record orphan sweep, and audio testing. Validate
      those controls on the target Windows account and approved resources. Server/Redis checks are
      live; external Blob/QStash status is only `configured-unverified`, so exercise real encrypted
      Blob and delayed-cleanup operations plus provider-outage recovery before approval.
- [ ] **Target hardware and Windows baseline.** Record desktop model, x64 capability, Windows
      edition/build/servicing date, TPM/BitLocker/endpoint management, account model, and installation
      permission.
- [ ] **Kiosk lockdown.** Confirm an edition supporting the chosen Shell Launcher/restricted-user
      model; test AppLocker/WDAC, GPO/MDM, keyboard escape, removable media, dialogs, task switching,
      admin access, firewall, crash dumps, page file, and update behavior.
- [ ] **.NET lifecycle migration.** The required implementation targets .NET 8, whose Microsoft end
      of support is **2026-11-10**. Select, implement, and retest a supported target before that date.
      Self-contained publish does not make unsupported runtime bits safe.
- [ ] **Signed installer/update chain.** The workflow now requires a protected Authenticode
      sign/verify job before creating a Release candidate. Obtain an approved certificate, configure
      reviewed `windows-signing`, choose installer/update distribution, timestamp and malware-scan
      builds, verify on target Windows, and prove rollback.
- [ ] **Exact printer/driver validation.** Printer model, firmware, connection, driver, queue name,
      A4/simplex/mono/fit/one-copy capabilities, status mapping, and XPS/GDI/render path are unknown and
      untested on physical hardware.
- [ ] **Duplicate/ambiguous-job fault tests.** Inject offline, paper-out, paused, jam, disconnect,
      spooler restart, driver crash, app crash, reboot, and power loss at each submit boundary. Prove no
      automatic retry when submission is uncertain.
- [ ] **Spooler/driver/printer retention.** Approve spool-file deletion/job history, crash dump/page
      file, driver cache, printer disk/firmware retention, and secure disposal/maintenance.
- [ ] **Kiosk recovery-journal policy.** The durable journal contains a SHA-256 session-ID hash,
      state, safe code, and timestamp. Approve and Windows-test its implemented 24-hour pruning for
      completed/rejected/administrator-resolved records and the authenticated P-04 acknowledgement
      path. Unresolved records must never be automatically pruned or replayed.
- [ ] **Physical output control.** Approve kiosk/printer placement, privacy/collection tray,
      completion audio/arrow, abandoned-print response, and accessibility.

## Content, accessibility, and operations

- [ ] **Native-speaker review.** English, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese, Mongolian, Thai,
      Russian, and Nepali copy/audio are placeholders until reviewed for accuracy and safe instruction.
- [ ] **Accessibility and low-literacy acceptance.** Test screen readers, focus/keyboard, contrast,
      reduced motion, touch targets, audio fallback/replay, QR comprehension, and 30-second reminder on
      representative iPhone/Android and kiosk hardware.
- [ ] **Usability KPI trial.** With synthetic documents and approved participants, measure
      scan-to-approval target (60 seconds), staff intervention, errors, stale-screen exposure, and
      duplicate print.
- [ ] **Operations ownership.** Name service, network, printer, Windows, provider, security/privacy,
      and after-hours incident owners; approve P/N/A/S runbook codes and maintenance windows.
- [ ] **Capacity/availability/rollback.** Load-test rate limits and provider quotas, define service
      availability/cleanup-lag alerts and acceptable outage, and exercise web/kiosk rollback.

## Evidence that does not close these blockers

- Local tests using memory/local adapters;
- a Vercel Preview without provider-policy approval;
- GitHub `windows-latest` WPF compilation;
- MockPrintEngine artifacts;
- a checksum without Authenticode signing;
- a successful print to a different printer/driver;
- developer review of machine-translated content;
- Redis TTL without demonstrated Blob deletion.
